> Draw graphs from your Thunderbird email inbox

This tool generates two kinds of graphics from your Thunderbird email client's
inbox.

Point being, that over a certain limit (2 emails per hour) you can't really
concentrate on your work anymore, because it takes up to 20 minutes to get the
flow back on after you receive and read an just-arrived email.

## How to run?

You can compile this project with your own data easily:

1. Download/clone this repo
2. Run the `refresh.sh` file
3. Put all these files to your web server (even a local will do)

**Done!**

## "Don't send that email" graph

This generates a graph that shows how probable it is for you to receive an email
*just now*. If the email flow is too much, the site's background turns to red.

A good link to send as an autoresponder email to all the people you hate.
